                 <p class="centerText"><i>A treatment that rejuvenates and resolves for naturally radiant, clearer skin</i></p>

                 <p> Dermalux LED Phototherapy is a multi-award winning treatment that combines clinically proven wavelengths of light delivered at therapeutic doses to naturally stimulate skin rejuvenation and resolve problem skin conditions for the face and body.</p>

                 <p> Utilising the latest generation Light Emitting Diode (LED) technology, Dermalux LED Phototherapy is clinically proven for the treatment of a wide range of skin concerns; to reduce the visible signs of ageing, pigmentation and environmental damage and resolve inflammatory skin conditions such as acne and rosacea. </p>

                 <p> LED Phototherapy has long been known for its healing and anti-inflammatory properties. Specific combinations of light stimulate collagen production, destroy acne causing bacteria, reduce inflammation, increase hydration, improve skin laxity, texture and clarity and ease muscular and joint pain. 
                 Unlike more invasive procedures that work as a result of the body's response to trauma, Dermalux is a non-invasive, pain free and safe treatment which is suitable for all skin types without downtime. </p>

                 <h2 class="centerHeadings"><i> How does LED Phototherapy work? </i></h2>

                 <p> While we often associate light exposure with negative effects such as skin ageing and damage, light also has many positive influences on the body. It helps us produce vitamin D and provides energy and serotonin for example. It can also accelerate tissue healing. </p>

                 <p> The differences between the positive and negative effects of light are the amount and the parts of the light spectrum we are exposed to. Whilst on-going exposure to UV is very damaging, controlled levels of Red, Blue and Near Infrared light are clinically proven to be beneficial.
                 LED Phototherapy is the application of beneficial light to our skin to stimulate various cellular processes to produce a therapeutic effect. Dermalux uses evidence-based wavelengths delivered at a skin-enhancing intensity and dose to activate cellular renewal and repair, fuel the manufacture of collagen and elastin, reduce inflammation and destroy acne causing bacteria. </p> 

                 <h2 class="centerHeadings"><i> Will the results be seen straight away? </i></h2>

                 <p> Following a Dermalux treatment, there are some immediate visible changes in the skin but most changes occur naturally over a series of treatments. Dermalux instantly revitalises a tired and dull complexion. After just one treatment skin is hydrated, plump and radiant and redness and irritation is calmed. LED Phototherapy also promotes a feeling of wellbeing, helping to relieve the stresses and strains of everyday life! </p> 
          
                 <p> A course of treatment offers lasting improvement in the appearance and health of the skin and results may continue to be seen up to 4 to 6 weeks. Dermalux can also be integrated with your regular skin treatments to optimise and accelerate results. Your Dermalux practitioner will advise you on the best combination of light and course of treatment depending on the condition of your skin. </p>
